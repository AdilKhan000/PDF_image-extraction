#This script was written to automate the process of extracting images from a textbook pdf and write it to a pdf file.
#I wrote this script when my brother who is a medical student requested me to help him separate only images from his textbook.
 
 Usage:
 Takes an input pdf.
 Gives the output images into a pdf file and stores all the images that generated an error into a separate folder.

 Improvements: 
 Can add a condition to separate the images with low pixels to be discarded as they can be useless images.
 Sorting and labeling the images with the text below the images.
